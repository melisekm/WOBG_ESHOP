        'Ticket to Ride, from Days of Wonder, is one of those ultimately simple yet compelling gateway games that continues to prove its place in the world of board gaming. In Ticket to Ride, 2-5 players compete against each other to earn the most victory points by placing train routes across the United States of America. Points depend on the length of the train route, the longer, the better. Routes are claimed by collecting and playing coloured cards that match the colour of the routes across the map. As the game progresses, the map starts to become crowded and the game can become more cutthroat as players start to cut each other off - or try to. Ticket to Ride is already a classic in gaming that has won endless awards and sold millions of copies worldwide. It''s suitable for newcomers to the hobby and gaming veterans alike.', '1 board map of European train routes
